# IP-Management Plugin
# Plugin name: ipmanagement
# Plugin description:
# Dynamically add/remove IPs from:
#    Monitoring lists
#    Deny lists
#    Drop lists
#    Allow lists
#    RuleEngineOff
#
# All requests from IPs in monitoring list will be logged (even if they don't trigger
#   other rules), whether request is allowed or not is not modified by plugin.
# All requests from IPs in deny list will be logged and denied.
# All request from IPs in drop list be silently dropped (no logging)
# All requests from IPs in allow list will be logged and allowed.
# All requests from IPs in RuleEngineOff list will have ModSec engine turned off (and 
#   therefore be allowed)
#
# Rule ID block base: 9,500,000 (range is 1000, thus ID block base +1000)
# Plugin version: 0.0.1

# This plugin initialises the IP collection to be just the IP (not with appended
#   user-agent. This behaviour is essential for this plugin to work as expected.
#   Plugin must run before IP collection is initialised elsewhere (eg. CRS 901321)
# Changing IP collection from CRS 901321:
#     initcol:ip=%{remote_addr}_%{tx.ua_hash}
#   to:
#     initcol:ip=%{remote_addr}
#   means that CRS (and any other IP based rules), may have reduced granularity
#     as User-Agent will not be used to try and distinguish between multiple
#     users/clients coming from the same IP.




# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
